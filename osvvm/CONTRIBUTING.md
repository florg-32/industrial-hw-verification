# Contributing

You may contribute bug reports and feature requests by submitting GitLab issues.

If you would like to propose code changes (aka pull requests), you must have filled out an IEEE CLA for the project.  Get the [IEEE CLA here](https://opensource.ieee.org/community/cla).    

Before contributing code to this repository, please propose your change via GitLab issues to first discuss the change you wish to make.   When adding features, we want to make sure to have consistency (such as naming) with other features - including features in other OSVVM packages.   After discussion and agreement, then post a GitLab pull request. 

Looking for ideas on what to contribute, please see our [Help Wanted List](HELPWANTED.md).

Please note that this project adheres to IEEE's [code of conduct](https://www.ieee.org/content/dam/ieee-org/ieee/web/org/about/ieee_code_of_conduct.pdf), we count on you to follow it in all your interactions with the project. Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior shall be reported to [supportcenter@ieee.org](mailto:supportcenter@ieee.org). 

## Pull Request Process

1. It is recommended that you refer to the [Git SCM](https://git-scm.com) webpage to chose the git client sw you will use. Our instructions assume you are using [gitbash](https://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Appendix-A%3A-Git-in-Other-Environments-Git-in-Bash) or its equivalent.

2. Get a copy of the project and change its default alias to "upstream":
```
git clone -- recursive https://opensource.ieee.org/osvvm/VerificationIP.git
git cd VerificationIP
git remote -v
git remote rename origin upstream
git checkout master
```

3. add your own repository under the default alias "origin" and save there the copy of the "upstream" repository:
```
git remote add origin https://opensource.ieee.org/<<-YOUR-USERID->>/VerificationIP
git push origin master
```

4. each time you may want to synchronize your copy of the repository with the "upstream" repository:
```
git fetch upstream
git checkout master
git rebase upstream/master
git push -f origin master
```

5. If you want to prepare some changes to merge with the "upstream" repository, first creat a branch and later create a merge request:
```
git checkout -b <<-MY-BRANCH-NAME->>
# add any new files or modify existing source
git add <<-MY-NEW-OR-UPDATED-FILE->> 
git commit -m "My great contriution to this project is ..." -s
git push origin <<-MY-BRANCH-NAME->>
```

6. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before pushing the changes.

7. Update the necessary README.md files with details of the changes; this includes new environment variables, references to Issues, useful file locations and parameters needed to invoque a build that will use the changes (helps for debugging or studying the change).

8. Increase the version numbers in the CHANGELOG.md, any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [Calendar Versioning YYYY.MM](https://calver.org/).

9. All contributions must be done using a merge request to allow for review.
